## Thoughtfully create really excellent inputs
### Framework to follow
**The T.C.R.E.I. Framework for Effective Prompts**
	• Task: Clearly describe the desired task, including a persona (the expertise the AI should draw from) and a preferred output format (e.g., bulleted list, table).
	• Context: Provide necessary details to help the AI understand your needs, making your request specific and informative.
**Enhancing and Refining Your Prompts**
	• References: Include examples or past information to guide the AI in generating more useful and relevant output.
	• Evaluate and Iterate: After receiving output, assess if it meets your needs. If not, refine your prompt by adding more information or tweaking it, as iteration is key to effective prompting.

### Follow the markdowns or XML style tags as much as you can for the building best prompts
<Task>...</Task>
<Context>...</Context>
<Format>...</Format>
<Constraints>...</Constraints>
<References></References>
**Use references for shot prompting**

#### Task Guidelines
1. Provide a clear persona to use for the prompts
2. Specify the format for the output (How should output look like)

### Context Guidelines
1. Provide a clear and concise context for the task to work on.
2. Mention phrases like:
   - `Use this as an input`
   - `Consider this as input while working on`

### Reference Guidelines
1. Use traditional phrases like
   - `Refer to these materials`
   - `Use folloring examples`
2. Label your examples with headings markdowns for hightlighting the examples
