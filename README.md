# Prompting Essentials

## Thoughtfully create really excellent inputs
### Framework to follow

**The T.C.R.E.I. Framework for Effective Prompts**

	• Task: Clearly describe the desired task, including a persona (the expertise the AI should draw from) and a preferred output format (e.g., bulleted list, table).
	• Context: Provide necessary details to help the AI understand your needs, making your request specific and informative.

**Enhancing and Refining Your Prompts**
	
	• References: Include examples or past information to guide the AI in generating more useful and relevant output.
	• Evaluate and Iterate: After receiving output, assess if it meets your needs. If not, refine your prompt by adding more information or tweaking it, as iteration is key to effective prompting.

### Follow the markdowns or XML style tags as much as you can for the building best prompts
```
<Task>...</Task>
<Context>...</Context>
<Format>...</Format>
<Constraints>...</Constraints>
<References>
	<Reference1>...</Reference1>
	<Reference2>...</Reference2>
</References>
```
> Use references for zero-shot or few-shot prompting

#### Task Guidelines
1. Provide a clear persona to use for the prompts
2. Specify the format for the output (How should output look like)

### Context Guidelines
1. Provide a clear and concise context for the task to work on.
2. Mention phrases like:
   - `Use this as an input`
   - `Consider this as input while working on`

### Reference Guidelines
1. Use traditional phrases like

   - `Refer to these materials`
   - `Use folloring examples`
2. Label your examples with headings markdowns for hightlighting the examples

# Advanced Prompting Essentials

## Chain-of-Thought (Cot)

For complex tasks, use the output of a gen AI tool to and use it as a context for the new prompt. Connecting prompts is like connecting links in a chain—which is why this process is called chain of thought. 

**Use phrases like to get more detailed reasoning or explanination:**
- `Explain your reasoning`
- `Go step-by-step`

**Use-cases:**

1. Brain-storming an idea
2. Iterative design building
3. Creative design thinking prototyping
4. Reasoning and evaluation use-cases

## Tree-of-Thought (Tot)

Tree-of-thought prompting is a technique for exploring multiple possible solutions at once, helping you find the most effective approach. Instead of following a single chain of thought, you generate several responses to your prompt, then evaluate and choose the best ones to pursue.

**Use phrases like to get more detailed reasoning or explanination:**
- `Show me three different designs with`
- `Come up with <n> different approaches`

**Use-cases:**
1. Decision-making usecases
2. Vetting process driven designs
3. Collaborative design with multiple users to get multiple options
4. Variant driven design decisions


## Multimodal Cot

Traditional CoT focuses on textual reasoning. Multimodal CoT is designed for complex tasks where the answer requires integrating information from different sources (e.g., a question about a scientific diagram).

The process is generally structured into two distinct stages:

Stage 1: Rationale Generation
Input: The question/task, the textual context, and the non-textual input (e.g., an image, a chart, or a diagram).

Process: The model is prompted to generate a detailed, step-by-step textual rationale or reasoning chain.

Key Feature: This rationale must explicitly incorporate and reference observations and information from both the text and the image/visual data. It's the "thinking aloud" process that connects the clues from all modalities.
