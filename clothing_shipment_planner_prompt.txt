<Constraint>
	- Your lead designer will be on holiday for one month, from June 16th to July 20th. 
	- Due to global shipping restrictions, your fabric shipments are likely to take six weeks, rather than the usual two weeks—including sample orders. 
	- Your usual manufacturer has gotten more expensive, so you'll need to allot some time to find a new manufacturer with more competitive pricing.
